# image-upload-on-server-using-node
Nodejs application to upload image on a server

To make this application
Step 1: Install nodejs on your device
Step 2: Create a folder for node app
Step 3: In the folder create package.json file and state the description and dependencies of your app.
Dependencies I have used : express,file-type,multer
Save the file and run command prompt on the location of folder
Give command "npm install" to install all the dependencies
Once the dependencies are installed go back to folder and create app.js file(Use the code provided)
Afterwards create folder server.js to configure your server
To run the server again open command prompt on the folder location and give cmd "npm start" to start the server
Once you get the message "Listening at 3000"
Go to browser and give path "http://localhost:3000/"
